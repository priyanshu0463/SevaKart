### **SevaKart ‚Äì Second-Hand Goods for Food Donation**  

## Overview  
**SevaKart** is a unique platform that bridges the gap between second-hand goods selling and food donation. It empowers communities to donate surplus food efficiently while funding logistics through a second-hand marketplace. By tracking community meals and connecting donors with the needy, SevaKart ensures that no food goes to waste. The revenue generated from the second-hand platform supports the logistics of food pickup and delivery, creating a sustainable and impactful cycle of giving.  

## Key Features  
- ‚úÖ **Second-Hand Marketplace for Good** ‚Äì Users can sell used items (clothes, electronics, furniture) to generate income, which funds food logistics.  
- ‚úÖ **Food Donation Simplified** ‚Äì Easy-to-use interface for listing surplus food with details like quantity and pickup time.  
- ‚úÖ **Community Meal Tracker** ‚Äì Tracks community meals, their capacity, and schedules to help the needy find meals effortlessly.  
- ‚úÖ **Smart Matching Algorithm** ‚Äì Matches food donors with the nearest community meals or needy households to minimize wastage.  
- ‚úÖ **Zero-Waste Pledge** ‚Äì Encourages users to donate instead of wasting food, rewarding them with badges or discounts on the second-hand platform.  
- ‚úÖ **Volunteer Network Integration** ‚Äì Connects volunteers for food collection and distribution, promoting community participation.  
- ‚úÖ **Offline-First Approach** ‚Äì Works seamlessly without internet connectivity, ensuring usability even in remote areas.  

## Why **SevaKart** Stands Out

3. **Community Empowerment** ‚Äì Involves volunteers in the distribution process, building a sense of community and shared responsibility.

4. **Volunteer Support** ‚Äì Volunteers are notified and assist in food collection and delivery.
